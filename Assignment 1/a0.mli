(* Assignment 0. A Bigint package
This is a preliminary assignment which will be used in following assignments.  In this assignment, you will write in OCaml a BIGNUM package  where you will implement arithmetic for arbitrarily large numbers, using lists of digits to implement an integer.

(* module type BigInt = sig *)
type bigint = sign * int list
  and sign = Neg | NonNeg
(* Representational invariant of the elements of the int list:
  - the elements of the int list are between 0 and 9
  - presented most significant digit first
  - there are no unnecessary leading zeros. *)
