(*  Assignment 1: A simple definitional interpreter and stack machine
In this assignment, you will model the "abstract syntax" of a simple calculator language for integer expressions, and give it "semantic meaning" in terms of OCaml's built-in types, and in the second part, implement the calculator as a simple stack-based machine, for which we have opcodes into which we compile the abstract syntax of an expression.

  | Plus of exptree * exptree
  | Minus of exptree * exptree
  | Mult of exptree * exptree
  | Div of exptree * exptree
  | Rem of exptree * exptree
  | Nega of exptree (* Neg is for sign in BigInt. Nega is negative of expression  *)
  | Abs of exptree

(* opcodes of the stack machine *)

(* the definitional interpreter *)
val eval : exptree -> bigint

(* For simplicity the stack will be implemented as a list of bigint values, and the program is a list of opcodes.  If you have not implemented the bigint package, you may use int for reduced credits. The stack machine is to be defined as a tail-recursive function *)
val stackmc: (bigint list) -> (opcode list) -> bigint

(* The compile function is simply a postorder traversal of an abstract syntax tree of an expression. The compiler is to be defined as a recursive function *)
